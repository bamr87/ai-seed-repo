You are an expert AI software architect specializing in agentic systems and autonomous code evolution. Your task is to plan and design a complete seed repository (boilerplate) for a self-evolving application. This repo will serve as the initial skeleton for any type of application (e.g., web API, CLI tool, or service), where AI agents handle incremental evolution via a CI/CD pipeline triggered by GitHub issues. The system incorporates multi-agent collaboration, automated testing, documentation, deployment, and self-improvement, with human oversight for approvals.

### Core Goals and Principles
- **Autonomy with Oversight**: AI agents should handle 80% of development tasks (planning, coding, testing, documenting, deploying, evolving), but include human-in-the-loop via GitHub PR reviews and issue comments.
- **Evolution Mechanism**: New features/enhancements are triggered by submitting a GitHub issue. A workflow runs AI agents to process the issue, generate changes, create a PR, and deploy if merged.
- **Modularity**: Design for easy extension—decouple agents, core app logic, and pipelines.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Language: Python 3.12+.
  - Agent Framework: CrewAI (for multi-agent orchestration; use its boilerplate as inspiration).
  - Integrations: Composio (for agent actions like GitHub API interactions), LangChain (optional for advanced tools like RAG).
  - LLMs: Configurable for OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4o) or Anthropic (e.g., Claude 3.5) APIs.
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions.
  - Documentation: MkDocs with Material theme and mkdocstrings plugin (auto-generates from docstrings).
  - Testing: Pytest.
  - Deployment: Docker for containerization; configurable for Vercel/Netlify or Kubernetes.
  - Other Libraries: PyYAML (for configs), Requests (for APIs), FastAPI (if starting as a web app), Pinecone/FAISS (for agent memory).
  - Secrets: Use GitHub Secrets for API keys.
- **MVP Core App**: Start with a simple Python web API (e.g., FastAPI "hello world") in src/, which agents can evolve.
- **AI Seed Instructions**: Include a YAML file with initial prompts/configs for agents, which the evolver agent can self-update.
- **Safety and Best Practices**: Enforce PEP8, type hints, security scans (e.g., Bandit integration), reflection loops for self-improvement, and A/B testing hooks.
- **Comprehensive Automated Documentation**: Ensure every code change updates docstrings; workflows auto-build/deploy docs to GitHub Pages.

### Step-by-Step Planning and Design Process
Follow these steps to create the seed repo design. Output your response in a structured format for easy implementation (e.g., by copying into a new GitHub repo).

1. **Plan the High-Level Architecture**:
   - Describe the overall system flow: Issue submission → Workflow trigger → Agent orchestration → Code gen/test/doc → PR creation → Human review → Merge/deploy → Feedback/evolution.
   - Outline agent roles: Planner (breaks issues into tasks), Coder (generates code), Tester (runs/generates tests), Documenter (updates docs), Deployer (handles deployments), Evolver (reflects and improves agents/system).
   - Detail evolution loop: Agents use feedback (e.g., test results, metrics) to update their own prompts/memory.
   - Consider scalability: Start lean (3-5 agents), allow dynamic agent spawning.

2. **Design the Repo Structure**:
   - Provide a tree-like diagram of folders/files.
   - For each key file/folder, explain its purpose and contents briefly.
   - Ensure modularity: e.g., agents/ for AI logic, src/ for evolvable app code.

3. **Generate Key Files and Code**:
   - Provide full code/content for critical files (e.g., agent scripts, workflows, seed YAML, README.md, requirements.txt, mkdocs.yml).
   - For agents: Use CrewAI syntax; include example prompts from seed YAML.
   - For workflows: YAML for GitHub Actions (e.g., evolve-on-issue.yaml to trigger on issues, ci-cd.yaml for standard pipeline, docs-build.yaml for auto-docs).
   - Include custom GitHub ISSUE_TEMPLATE for standardized evolution requests.
   - MVP src/main.py: A simple FastAPI app.
   - Tests: Basic pytest examples.
   - Dockerfile: Basic Python setup.
   - Ensure all code is executable and follows best practices (docstrings, comments).

4. **Incorporate AI Seed Instructions**:
   - Design seed_instructions.yaml with sections for global_rules, per-agent prompts, llm_config, and memory.
   - Prompts should include placeholders (e.g., {issue_text}) and guide agents on tasks like reflection.

5. **Automate Documentation and Pipelines**:
   - Detail how Documenter agent and workflows ensure docs are always up-to-date.
   - Include pre-commit hooks or workflow steps for linting/docs gen.

6. **Edge Cases and Enhancements**:
   - Plan for handling failures (e.g., agent retries, human notifications via Slack/email).
   - Suggest future evolutions: Integrate RAG for knowledge retrieval, add support for other languages.

### Output Format
Structure your response as follows:
- **Section 1: Architecture Plan** (Narrative summary).
- **Section 2: Repo Structure Tree** (ASCII tree).
- **Section 3: Detailed File Contents** (Code blocks for each major file, with explanations).
- **Section 4: Setup and Usage Instructions** (How to initialize and trigger the first evolution).
- **Section 5: Potential Improvements** (Ideas for the evolver agent to implement later).

Ensure the design is comprehensive yet concise—aim for a ready-to-use boilerplate that can be built in under an hour. If needed, reference open-source examples like CrewAI templates for inspiration, but generate original content.
