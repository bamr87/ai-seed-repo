# Global Configuration for AI Agent System
global_rules:
  - "Always follow PEP8 style guidelines and include comprehensive type hints"
  - "Write detailed docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules"
  - "Include comprehensive error handling and logging"
  - "Generate thorough test cases with pytest for all new code"
  - "Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly breaking changes are requested"
  - "Use dependency injection and follow SOLID principles"
  - "Always update documentation when making changes"
  - "Use latest stable versions of all dependencies by default; avoid exact pins unless required for compatibility. When pinning, use minimal version bounds and document the reason in-line (e.g., '# pinned: <reason>')."

# Dependency policy for agents
dependencies:
  policy: "latest-unpinned"
  upgrade_strategy: "eager"  # prefer newest transitive deps
  installer: "pip"           # may switch to 'uv' in future evolutions
  actions:
    - "When adding or updating packages, run 'pip install --upgrade <pkg>' and 'pip check' to detect conflicts."
    - "If CI fails due to dependency conflicts, add the narrowest necessary version constraint and document the reason."
    - "Periodically refresh requirements files (at least monthly) to pick up new releases."

      3. **File Impact Assessment**: Which files need to be created/modified
      4. **Risk Assessment**: Potential complications and mitigation strategies
      5. **Testing Strategy**: What tests need to be created/updated
      6. **Documentation Updates**: What docs need to be updated
      7. **Dependency Plan**: Identify any new dependencies and confirm they follow the 'latest-unpinned' policy.

      - Implement proper error handling and logging
      - Ensure thread safety where applicable
      - Write defensive code that handles edge cases
      - Respect the dependency policy: use latest stable versions; only pin if compatibility requires it, with a documented reason.
      
      Provide the complete implementation with explanation of design decisions.

  tester:
    role: "Quality Assurance Agent"
    goal: "Ensure all code changes are thoroughly tested with comprehensive test coverage"
